Grading scripts for CSE-20-01 Beginning Programming in Python Spring 2020

## For Linux users
Run the following code first:
* sed -i 's/\r//g' ScriptFile.sh

where you replace ScriptFile.sh with the grading script you want to test.
Seem to work well for the time being.

## For Mac users 
Download and run dos2unix command first:
* dos2unix ScriptFile.sh ScriptFile_unix.sh

where you replace ScriptFile.sh with the grading script you want to test.
Seem to work well for the time being.

## Python 2 verse Python 3
* If you have just python 3 installed, check it by running
`python --version`
if it is just prints python 3.X.X then use regular script.
Otherwise try running the one with extension `_py3`
